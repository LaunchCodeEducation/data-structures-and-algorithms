Insertion Sort
==============

.. IDEA:
  case studies:
    in main doc: pseudocode
    link to: directory of implementations in various languages
      c# for this first draft

What is the insertion sort algorithm. What are the two implementations of this algorithm?

Link back to the recursion lesson in LC101.

Recursive
^^^^^^^^^

What does the solution look like in C#? (psuedo-code)

How do we calculate this algorithm's run time complexity?

How do we now put that run time complexity into Big O notation?

Non-Recursive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
