Analyzing Algorithms With Big-O Notation
========================================

Types of Time Complexity
------------------------

.. 
  relative to:
    a single step
    the overall algorithm
  how steps become additive
    dominance of highest order
      why?
      rejecting constants and lower orders
        theoretical vs practical rejection

- Constant -- same number of steps every time
- Polynomial linear -- single pass over the entire data
- Polynomial quadratic -- 
- log -- s

Worst Case?
-----------

Bring back the first section definition highlighting worst case or upper bounds.

- What do we mean by worst case? 
- What is best case? 
- Why don't we use Big O notation for best case?

.. TODO: Should Big O Operations be discussed here? or analyzing with big o notation?

Big O Operations
----------------

What do we mean by operations?

- Sum
- Product
- multiplication by product
