Exercises: Big-O Notation
=========================

#. Given un-reduced big-o, calculate the reduced.

#. (provide a few algorithms and calculate the un-simplified and simplified big-O for each)

- reversing a string

- leap year

#. Suppose you have an array of ``Customer`` objects, sorted in alphabetical order. For each of the following tasks, determine the run time in terms of big-O. 

   #. Print the names of all of the customers.

   #. Print the names of only the customers with last name starting with "A".

   #. Find all customers with last name beginning with "A".

   #. Find all customers with first name beginning with "A".

#. Now supposed that you have a dictionary (or hash map) of customer objects, where the keys are letters and the values are arrays storing all customers with last name beginning with that letter. For example, of our dictionary is ``customers`` then ``customers["A"]`` is an array of all customers with last name ending with "A". Within each array, the customer objects are not sorted in any way. 

   #. Print the names of all of the customers.

   #. Print the names of only the customers with last name starting with "A".

   #. Find all customers with last name beginning with "A".

   #. Find all customers with first name beginning with "A".
