----

Big-O Notation is a mechanism for describing the performance of an algorithm, an ordered sequence of steps, in relation to its input. In other words, it is a method for analyzing the steps in a function and how the size of its argument impacts the time it takes to complete those steps. The result of the analysis is referred to as the `[run]time complexity` of the algorithm that was analyzed.


Deriving and comparing the time complexity of algorithms is essential to writing performant systems throughout the countless avenues of applied Computer Science. To that end, there are three main considerations in classifying an algorithm using Big-O Notation:

- the size of the input (colloquially known as ``n``)
- the time complexity of each step in the algorithm
- the order in which the steps are executed
