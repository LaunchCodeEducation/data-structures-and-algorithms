Defining Big-O Notation
=======================

What
----

Big O notation is an equation that describes how efficient the worst case of an algorithm is.

Why
---

Example that shows why we need to understand how efficient an algorithm is, and how we can describe in plain english that one algorithm is more efficient than another algorithm.

.. TODO: should HOW and Types of Time Complexity be moved to analyzing with big-o notation?

How
---

Diagrams (or table) of most common Big O run times (O(log n), O(n), O(n + log n), O(n^2), O(n!))

- Define O
- Define n
- Define log

Bring the diagrams (or table) together with the definitions above.

Types of Time Complexity
------------------------

- Constant
- Polynomial linear
- Polynomial quadratic
- log

Worst Case?
-----------

Bring back the first section definition highlighting worst case. 

- What do we mean by worst case? 
- What is best case? 
- Why don't we use Big O notation for best case?

.. TODO: Should Big O Operations be discussed here? or analyzing with big o notation?

Big O Operations
----------------

What do we mean by operations?

- Sum
- Product
- multiplication by product

Another Example?
----------------

.. TODO: move following section to insertion-sort doc

Case Study: Insertion Sort
--------------------------

What is the insertion sort algorithm. What are the two implementations of this algorithm?

Link back to the recursion lesson in LC101.

Recursive
^^^^^^^^^

How do we calculate this algorithm's run time complexity?

How do we now put that run time complexity into Big O notation?

Non-Recursive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How do we calculate this algorithm's run time complexity?

How do we now put that run time complexity into Big O notation?
