Defining Big-O Notation
=======================

What
----

Big O notation is an equation that describes how efficient the worst case of an algorithm is.

Why
---

Example that shows why we need to understand how efficient an algorithm is, and how we can describe in plain english that one algorithm is more efficient than another algorithm.

How
---

Diagrams (or table) of most common Big O run times (O(log n), O(n), O(n + log n), O(n^2), O(n!))

- Define O
- Define n
- Define log

Bring the diagrams (or table) together with the definitions above.

Worst Case?
-----------

Bring back the first section definition highlighting worst case. 

- What do we mean by worst case? 
- What is best case? 
- Why don't we use Big O notation for best case?

Another Example?
----------------

A final example that pulls together everything they know -- maybe ask the reader to think about which Big O notation it would be and then present the answer.
