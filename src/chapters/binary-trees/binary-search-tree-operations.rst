Binary Search Tree Operations
=============================

.. relevant objectives
- Explain how to carry out binary search on a binary search tree
- Understand Binary Search Tree Operations and their Big-O efficiency
- Understand common operations on BSTs and their Big-O efficiency
    - insert
    - remove
    - traverse

.. relevant notes from paul
- Binary Search Tree Search (how is it done)
- Binary Search Tree operations (insert, remove, traverse)
- Big O of binary search tree operations, and binary search

Importance of Balance
---------------------

.. with regards to adding, or removing nodes how does this affect balance? If the balance is affected how do you ensure the tree can be searched via BS?

.. lead into the operations and how every operation will also have to ensure the tree is still balanced

BST Operations
--------------

.. destructive operation vs non-destructive operation? Search is non-desctructive, but inserting, and removing is destructive.

Search
^^^^^^

.. is traverse the same thing as search? if not how are they different and do they need separate sections?

.. Big-O of Search

Insert
^^^^^^

.. how do you keep the tree balanced when inserting?

.. Big-O of Insertion

Remove
^^^^^^

.. how do you keep the tree balanced when removing?

.. Big-O of Remove
